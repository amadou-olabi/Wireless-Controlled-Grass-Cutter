# Wireless-Controlled-Grass-Cutter
Wireless Controlled Grass Cutter is an Arduino Project in which we have implemented a wireless system for controlling the Grass Cutter Device via an Analog Joystick. 
For this project, we used two Microcontrollers (Arduino Uno &amp; Nano) to model the system architecture of our proposed modules : 
--> Joystick Control Module &amp; 
--> Grass Cutter Car Module).
